# Credentials
URL: **http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org**</br>
Username: **natas0**</br>
Password: **natas0**</br>

# Level goal
Find the password on the webpage

# Explanation 

On first sight, there's nothing visible on the page itself even when you try to highlight text.

Maybe we can find something in the source code ü§ê.

Looking inside the body tag:
```html
<body>
	<h1>natas0</h1>
	<div id="content">
		You can find the password for the next level on this page.
		<!--The password for natas1 is gtVrDuiDfck831PqWsLEZy5gyDz1clto -->
	</div>
</body>
```
